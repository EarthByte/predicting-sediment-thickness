# Readme for updating the calibration files and the sediment thickness and rate relationships

To update the sediment thickness and rate relationships, you first need to update `alldata`. 

`alldata` is essentially a text file with the columns:

lon | lat | sedrate | sedthick | age | PCB_mean_dist | river_mouth: amazon | river_mouth: congo | river_mouth: ganges | river_mouth: godavari | river_mouth: Indus | river_mouth: magdalena | river_mouth: mahanadi | river_mouth: mississippi | river_mouth: narmada | river_mouth: niger | river_mouth: orinoco | river_mouth: paleo-congo | river_mouth: parana

This can be done by:

1. Seting your preferred age grid and sediment thickness grid in `calculate_decompacted_sed_rate_and_xyz.sh`, and run. 
    * **NOTE**: Make sure the script it calls (`average_sedimentation_rate.py`) is calculating (decompacted) rate.
This is in the `average_sedimentation_rate` function (around lines 273/274). 
    * This will also create 1 degree versions of your age and sediment thickness grids.
2. Launch the notebook `update_alldata.ipynb`. This notebook:
    * Copies your original `alldata` file to `alldata_orig`
    * Reads in the new 1Â° versions of the age, sediment thickness, and sediment rate grids (created in part 1).
    * Replaces the age/sediment thickness/sediment rate columns of `alldata` with these new grids
    * Saves out the data as `alldata`

3. Running `sediment_thick.ipynb` to get the new sediment thickness relationship. 
      * The new parameters are in the last cell (mean/variance/max of age and distance, polynomial coefficients and intercept).
      * Replace the values in lines 302-310 of [02_generate_predicted_sedimentation_grids.py](/02_generate_predicted_sedimentation_grids.py) with these new parameters. Note that the *age_distance_polynomial_coefficients* is in the form `polynomial intercept, polynomial coefficents[1:-1]` (i.e. replace the first `0` with the polynomial intercept)
4. Running `sediment_rate.ipynb` to get the new sediment rate relationship.
      * The new parameters are in the last cell (mean/variance/max of age and distance, polynomial coefficients and intercept).
      * Replace the values in lines 237-245 of [02_generate_predicted_sedimentation_grids.py](/02_generate_predicted_sedimentation_grids.py) with these new parameters. Note that the *age_distance_polynomial_coefficients* is in the form `polynomial intercept, polynomial coefficents[1:-1]` (i.e. replace the first `0` with the polynomial intercept)
